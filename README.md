# Quartz for Endless TBC (3.3.5 custom client)

![Quartz Swing Bar Seal Twisting](/QuartzTwist.png)

Modification to the swing bar to better detect weapon speed change and display hints for seal twisting. The yellow bar (*seal twisting window of opportunity*) is the delay before your next auto attack (300ms on beta) while both seal are active. The red bar is the last moment (given your current GCD) allowing a spell GCD to finish before the yellow bar.

The seal twisting comes disabled by default, go to the Quartz option panel to toogle it.
